Python Data Structures Overview
Main Subject: Data Structures

Linked List
Description: A linear collection of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence.
Key Operations: Insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.

Doubly Linked List
Description: Similar to a linked list but with nodes that also reference the previous node.
Key Operations: Insertion (prepend), deletion, and reverse, in addition to linked list operations.

Stack
Description: A last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure with push and pop operations.
Key Operations: Push (add to top), pop (remove from top), and peek (view top element).

Queue
Description: A first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.
Key Operations: Enqueue (add to end), dequeue (remove from front), and front (view first element).
Binary Search Tree (BST)
Description: A tree data structure with nodes that follow the left child < parent < right child rule.
Key Operations: Insertion, deletion, and search with efficient average-case performance.

Tree Traversal
Description: Methods of visiting all nodes in a tree data structure.
Types:
Inorder: Visit left subtree, node, then right subtree.
Preorder: Visit node, then left and right subtrees.
Postorder: Visit left and right subtrees, then node.
